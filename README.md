# Assignment 1: Starter exercises

## Objectives
1. The objective of this assignment is to allow you to familiarize yourself 
with the basics of Python.
## Instructions
1. Complete each of the the tasks below and submit them for grading.
### Basics
1. Create 3 variables and assign them a value.
    1. Create a variable called my_string and assign it a string value
    1. Create a variable called my_integer and assign it an integer value
    1. Create a variable called my_float and assign it a float value
1. Create two new integer variables with any values.
    1. Write code to add those variables, storing the result in a third variable. 
    1. In a comment, write what you expect the value of the third variable to be.
    1. Print out the value of the third variable to verify that it has the correct value.
    1. In a comment, write what you expect the type of the third variable to be.
    1. Print out the type of the third variable
    1. In a comment, write what the output type was and an explanation of why that is.
1. Create two new float variables with any values.

For next steps you are going to need to use Python functions. Well, that 
should say more Python functions because you have been using the print 
function already.

Functions accept input and turn it into a result. For example, print takes 
a message to display on the screen, but other than doing that, doesn’t return 
any results that we need for now.

Other useful functions are str, which converts a number to a str, round, 
which takes a number and count of decimals places, and returns the number 
rounded (so round(6.4352, 3) returns 6.46. Also type takes any variable name 
and returns its type.

### Try these tasks now:
1. Assign a string, integer and float value to variables called respectively 
mystring, myinteger and myfloat. Write code to prove that the values really 
are a str, int and float.
1. Can you find a way to add an int value to a str? Check the resulting value.
1. Multiply 5 by 7.654321 and round to 3 decimal places. Check the resulting 
value.
1. Use the input function to display a message that says “Enter your name” and 
places the result in a variable called myname. Check the resulting value.
1. Use the input function to display a message that says “Enter your favorite 
number” and places the result in a variable called favorite_number. Check the 
resulting value. And check its type. Any surprises?
1. Now, use input to display a message asking for a number. Then another 
message asking for a second number. Then print the sum of the two numbers. 
Check the resulting values. Any surprises? For 4 and 5 the program should 
display 9. If it doesn’t investigate and fix the error.
